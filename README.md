Full tutorial can be read [here](https://medium.com/@habibridho/javascript-es7-async-await-tutorial-64275c81ce2e)

## How to use
Make sure you have node 8.x since async-await syntax is only available in that version. To run the project.
First, install the dependency. Don't worry, it only has one dependency.
```
npm install
```
Then, for the basic promise example, you can run
```
node index.js
```
Or, for the async-await example,
```
node async.js
```
